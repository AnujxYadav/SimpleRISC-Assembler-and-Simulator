The assembler will take SimpleRISC instructions and will generate corresponding binary and the simulator will convert that binary code to produce meaningful output.

The following repository contains : 

-> The Assignment file conatins all ISA set that it supports and functioning of each ISA.

-> Assembler code written in c++

-> Simulator code written in python
